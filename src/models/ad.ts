If strictly AdDto, it might be missing, but let's assume it's there or map it. Wait, the user provided AdDto doesn't have ID. Let's look at AdController? It returns Page<AdDto>. AdDto has no ID. This is problematic for React keys and actions. I should stick to the user's provided AdDto for now but I might need to ask or assume ID is present if I need it. actually, let's look at the previous MOCK_ADS, they had ID. The backend AdDto *should* probably have an ID. I'll add it as optional or check if I can add it. actually, looking at the user request: "this is how it looks in the frontend package... public class AdDto ...". It indeed has no ID. Accessing details might be hard without ID. However, the user said "this will be the data structure". I will implement it as requested.

// If the backend actually returns an ID, we should add it. For now I will follow the snippet strictly but maybe add an optional id if I suspect it's needed for the table.
// Actually, let's add `id?: number` just in case, or maybe the backend AdDto *does* have it and the snippet was truncated? No, "this is how it looks".
// Wait, the existing AdItem has `id`. If I remove it, the table keys will break.
// I will assume for now that the backend *will* provide an ID or I might have to use something else as key (maybe title + date?).
// Let's look at AdController. It returns `Page<AdDto>`.
// I will implement `Ad` interface based on `AdDto`.
